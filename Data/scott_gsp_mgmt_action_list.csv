Tier,Title,Description,Similar Scenario Categor(y/ies),Scenario_id
I,Watermaster Program (two creeks),"Watermaster services currently exist on Wildcat Creek and French Creek.  Among other things, a watermaster provides enforcement of water leases under the authority of Scott River Water Trust and 1707 dedications and transfers.",Low Flow Diversion Limits (FlowLims),flowlims
I,Scott River Water Trust Leasing Program,"Voluntary program leases water from active water diverters on priority stream reaches in exchange for financial compensation.
Diverters include but are not limited to SVID, Farmers Ditch, and locations on French Creek, Sugar Creek, and Shackleford Creek.",Low Flow Diversion Limits (FlowLims),flowlims
I,Irrigation Improvements,Improvements in irrigation efficiency in Scott River Valley (as detailed in Chapter 2.2.1.5).,Improved Irrigation Efficiency (IrrEff),"irr_eff_improve_0.1, irr_eff_improve_0.2"
II,Irrigation Efficiency Improvements,"Increase irrigation efficiency (and in some cases, yields) through infrastructure or equipment improvements. Consider funding incentives through the NRCS EQIP program.",Improved Irrigation Efficiency (IrrEff),"irr_eff_improve_0.1, irr_eff_improve_0.2"
II,"MAR & ILR  - NFWF
Scott Recharge Project","Evaluate use of groundwater recharge as to augment Scott River flows during critical periods (i.e., late summer and fall).",Enhanced Recharge (Enh- Rch),"mar, ilr, mar_ilr"
II,MAR & ILR,Managed aquifer recharge and - during the irrigation season - in lieu recharge on irrigated agricultural land to increase baseflow during the critical summer and fall low flow period.,Enhanced Recharge (Enh- Rch),"mar, ilr, mar_ilr"
II,Voluntary Managed Land Repurposing,"Reduce water use through voluntary managed land repurposing activities including term contracts, crop rotation, irrigated margin reduction, conservation easements, and other uses",Possibly Crop Change (CropCh) and possibly some amount of Natural Vegetation Land Use (NatVeg) ,"irrig_0.8, irrig_0.9, natveg_inside_adj, natveg_gwmixed_inside_adj, natveg_outside_adj, natveg_gwmixed_outside_adj, natveg_inside_adj_et_check_1.0nvkc_4.5m_ext, natveg_gwmixed_inside_adj_et_check_1.0nvkc_4.5m_ext, natveg_outside_adj_et_check_1.0nvkc_4.5m_ext, natveg_gwmixed_outside_adj_et_check_1.0nvkc_4.5m_ext"
III,"Alternative, lower ET crops","Pilot programs on introducing alternative crops with lower ET but sufficient economic value.
Incentivize and provide extension on long-term shift to lower ET crops.",Crop Change (CropCh),"irrig_0.8, irrig_0.9"
III,Floodplain Reconnection/ Expansion,"Expand access of the Scott River to old or new floodplain features to promote groundwater recharge, create habitat, provide more functional ecosystem, while also recharging groundwater, possibly as part of conservation easements",Enhanced Recharge (Enh- Rch),"mar, ilr, mar_ilr"
III,Reservoirs,Construct surface water reservoir (s) to capture and store runoff and excess stream flows to augment Scott River flows during critical periods,Small Reservoir (Res),"reservoir_shackleford, reservoir_etna, reservoir_french, reservoir_sfork, reservoir_etna_29kAF"
III,Strategic Groundwater Pumping Curtailment,Strategic timing of groundwater pumping curtailments. This management action would only be developed if Tier I and Tier II PMAs are insufficient. It would be an alternative tool for the GSA in support of the groundwater level SMC.,Possibly Cease Alfalfa Irrigation Early (AlfIrr); Possibly Curtail Irrigation Early (Curtail),"alf_irr_stop_jul10, alf_irr_stop_aug01, alf_irr_stop_aug01_dry_yrs_only, alf_irr_stop_aug15, alf_irr_stop_aug15_dry_yrs_only, curtail_start_jun01, curtail_start_jun15, curtail_start_jul01, curtail_start_jul15, curtail_start_aug01, curtail_start_aug15"
III,Watermaster Program (expanded),"Water master services on tributaries other than Wildcat Creek and French Creek and on the Scott River.  Among other things, a water master provides enforcement of water leases and 1707 dedications and transfers.",Low Flow Diversion Limits (FlowLims),flowlims
